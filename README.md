## Introduction

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set".

We have to come out with the four graphs shown below and upload the 
png files as well as the R script that was used to construct the 
graphs. 

I have done this on a Windows 8, using R Studio.

The four plots that you will need to construct are shown below.
